# Dash for Vision Zero
Summary:
     This sample project uses data from Berkley's [Transportation Injury Mapping Sytem (TIMS)](https://tims.berkeley.edu/) to provide an example of how [Plotly's Dash Library](https://plot.ly/dash/) can be used to create quick interactive collision dashboards for data sharing, exploratory data analysis, and public communication efforts. 
	 This project can be modified as you see fit.
